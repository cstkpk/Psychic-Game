# Psychic Game

* The Psychic Game is a JavaScript game where you try to guess the letter (from a - z) that the computer has randomly chosen. If you guess the correct letter, you win the round and your score goes up by one. If you guess an incorrect letter, you can continue trying new letters until your guesses run out. If your guesses run out, you lose that round and your losses go up by one. After you finish the round, the computer will choose a new letter for you to guess.

* How strong are your psychic abilities? Can you read the computer's mind?

* Good luck!
